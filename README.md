## This branch is not used/ hosted anymore
For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to add google analytics and a crypto miner a long time ago, now the main branch is being hosted under tylerpalko.github.io

# ⚠️DON'T FORK THIS BRANCH⚠️
This branch contains the g-tag for google analtics and will make your code messy if you use it.
